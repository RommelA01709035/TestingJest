# TestingJest
In this repository I am going to do examples of test cases with the tool jest
first You need to do your own data base to use this code and obviusly wrote your personal data.

When you installed Jest, you need to use "npm test" as command to run test cases and in your package-json add the next lines
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }

  For better information than me, this the official link:
